<h1>Crux</h1>
<p><b>Crux</b> (<small>pron.:</small> /ˈkrʌks/) is the smallest of the 88 modern constellations, but is one of the most distinctive. Its name is Latin for cross, and it is dominated by a cross-shaped asterism that is commonly known as the <b>Southern Cross</b>.</p>
<h2> Visibility</h2>




<p>Crux is easily visible from the southern hemisphere at practically any time of year. It is also visible near the horizon from tropical latitudes of the northern hemisphere for a few hours every night during the northern winter and spring. For instance, it is visible from Cancun or any other place at latitude 25° N or less at around 10 pm at the end of April.</p>
<h2> Location and identification</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>, Crux is not opposite to Ursa Major. In fact, in tropical regions both Crux (low in the south) and Ursa Major (low in the north) can be seen in the sky from April to June. Crux is exactly opposite to Cassiopeia on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot appear in the sky with the latter at the same time. For locations south of 34°S, Crux is circumpolar and thus always visible in the night sky.</p>
<p>Crux is bordered by the constellations Centaurus (which surrounds it on three sides) and Musca.</p>
<p>Crux is sometimes confused with the nearby False Cross by stargazers. Crux is somewhat kite-shaped, and it has a fifth star (ε Crucis). The False Cross is diamond-shaped, somewhat dimmer on average, does not have a fifth star and lacks the two prominent nearby "Pointer Stars."</p>
<h2> Notable features</h2>

<h3> Stars</h3>
<p>Three of the five main Crux stars—Acrux, Mimosa, and Delta Crucis—are co-moving B-type members of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, the nearest OB association to the Sun. They are among the highest-mass stellar members of the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the association, with ages of roughly 10 to 20 million years.</p>
<h4> Markers</h4>
<p>Since the southern sky lacks an easily visible pole star, Alpha and Gamma (known as Acrux and Gacrux respectively) are commonly used to mark south. Tracing a line from Gacrux to Acrux leads to a point close to the Southern Celestial Pole. Alternatively, if a line is constructed perpendicularly between Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, the point where the above mentioned line and this line intersect marks the Southern Celestial Pole. The two stars of Alpha and Beta Centauri are often referred to as the "Southern Pointers" or just "The Pointers", allowing people to easily find the asterism of the Southern Cross or the constellation of Crux.</p>
<h4> Letters and names</h4>
<p>The four main stars that form the asterism are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Crucis. Alpha Crucis, called Acrux, is a triple star 321 light-years from Earth. Blue-tinged and magnitude 0.8 to the unaided eye, it has two close components of magnitude 1.3 and 1.8, as well as a wide component of magnitude 5. The two close components are divisible in a small amateur telescope and the wide component is divisible in a pair of binoculars. Beta Crucis, called Mimosa, is a blue-hued giant of magnitude 1.3, 353 light-years from Earth. It is a Beta Cephei-type Cepheid variable with a variation of less than 0.1 magnitudes.Gamma Crucis, called Gacrux, is a double star. The primary is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 1.6, 88 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 6.5, 264 light-years from Earth. Delta Crucis is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.8, 364 light-years from Earth. It is the dimmest of the Southern Cross stars.</p>
<p>There are several dimmer stars within the borders of Crux. Epsilon Crucis is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6, 228 light-years from Earth. Iota Crucis is a binary star 125 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is of magnitude 9.5. Mu Crucis is a double star where the unrelated components are about 370 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.0 and the secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.1. Mu Crucis is divisible in small amateur telescopes or large binoculars.</p>
<h3> Deep-sky objects</h3>
<p>The Coalsack Nebula is the most prominent dark nebula in the skies, easily visible to the naked eye as a prominent dark patch in the southern Milky Way. It is large, five degrees by seven degrees, and is 600 light-years from Earth. Not all of the nebula is in the borders of Crux; some of it is technically in Musca and Centaurus.</p>
<p>The open cluster NGC 4755, better known as the Jewel Box or Kappa Crucis Cluster, has an overall magnitude of 4.2—to the naked eye it appears to be a fuzzy star—and is about 7600 light-years from Earth. The cluster was given its name by John Herschel. About seven million years old, an age that makes it one of the youngest open clusters in the Milky Way, it appears to have the shape of a letter A. The Jewel Box Clusters is a Shapley class g and Trumpler class I 3 r cluster; it is a very rich, centrally-concentrated cluster detached from the surrounding star field. It has more than 100 stars that range significantly in brightness. The brightest stars are mostly blue supergiants, though the cluster contains a few bright red supergiants. Kappa Crucis is a true member of the cluster that bears its name, and is one of the brighter star at magnitude 5.9.</p>
<h2> History</h2>

<p>Crux was visible to the Ancient Greeks; Ptolemy regarded it as part of the constellation Centaurus. It was entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the precession of the equinoxes gradually lowered its stars below the European horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By AD 400, most of the constellation never rose above the horizon for Athenians.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>The 15th century Venetian navigator Alvise Cadamosto made note of what was probably the Southern Cross on exiting the Gambia River in 1455, calling it the <i>carro dell'ostro</i> ("southern chariot"). However, Cadamosto's constellation had too many stars and was tilted incorrectly. Historians generally credit João Faras - astronomer and physician of King Manuel I of Portugal who accompanied Pedro Álvares Cabral in the discovery of Brazil in 1500 - for being the first European to depict it correctly. Faras sketched and described the constellation (calling it "Las Guardas") in a letter written on the beaches of Brazil on May 1, 1500, to the Portuguese monarch.Émerie Mollineux has also been cited as the first uranographer to distinguish Crux; his illustration dates to 1592. Later adopters of the constellation included Jakob Bartsch in 1624 and Augustin Royer in 1679. Royer is also sometimes cited as initially distinguishing Crux. Explorer Amerigo Vespucci depicted Crux as an almond, called "Mandorla".</p>
<p>The separation of Crux from Centaurus is generally attributed to the French astronomer Augustin Royer in 1679, but other historians attribute the invention of Crux to Petrus Plancius in 1613. However, Crux was later published by Jakob Bartsch in 1624.</p>
<h2> Cultural significance of the Southern Cross</h2>
<p>The most prominent feature of Crux is the distinctive asterism known as the Southern Cross. It has great significance in the cultures of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<h3> Flags and symbols</h3>


<p>Beginning in the colonial age, Crux became used as a national symbol by several southern nations. The brightest stars of Crux appear on the flags of Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Samoa. They also appear on the flags of the Australian state of Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, as well as the flag of Magallanes Region of Chile, the flag of Londrina (Brazil) and several Argentine provincial flags and emblems (for example, <i>Tierra del Fuego</i> and <i>Santa Cruz</i>). The flag of the Mercosur trading zone displays the four brightest stars. Crux also appears on the Brazilian coat of arms.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Southern Cross played a crucial role as symbol of the Eureka Stockade. In the Eureka Oath from Peter Lalor's famous speech in 1854 under the Eureka Flag he proclaimed "We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties." Of the Australian national flag, the Australian poet Banjo Paterson wrote in 1893:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The English flag may flutter and wave,<br>
where the world wide oceans toss,<br>
but the flag the Australian dies to save,<br>
is the flag of the Southern Cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Southern Cross was written into the lyrics of "Advance Australia Fair" in 1901: "Beneath our radiant Southern Cross"; the song was adopted as the Australian National Anthem in 1984. The victory song of the Australian national cricket team is entitled "Under the Southern Cross I Stand".</p>
<p>The Southern Cross was included in the lyrics of the Brazilian National Anthem (1909): "<i>A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece</i>" ("the image of the Cross shines"). The five stars are also in the logo of the Brazilian football team Cruzeiro Esporte Clube and the Brazilian coat of arms; it is mentioned in the Brazilian national anthem, and even featured as the name of the currency (the <i>cruzeiro</i> from 1942 to 1986 and again from 1990 to 1994. The constellation is displayed in all coins of the current series of the Brazilian real.</p>
<p>In O Sweet Saint Martin's Land, the lyrics for the Southern Cross are <i>Thy Southern Cross the night</i>.</p>
<p>A stylized version of Crux appears on the Australian Eureka Flag. The constellation was also used on the dark blue, shield-like patch worn by personnel of the U.S. Army's Americal Division, which was organized in the Southern Hemisphere, on the island of New Caledonia, and also the blue diamond of the U.S. 1st Marine Division, which fought on the Southern Hemisphere islands of Guadalcanal and New Britain.</p>
<h3> In non-Western astronomy</h3>
<p>In Australian Aboriginal astronomy, Crux and the Coalsack mark the head of the 'Emu in the Sky' in several Aboriginal cultures, while Crux itself is said to be a possum sitting in a tree and a representation of the sky deity Mirrabooka.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>In ancient Hindu astrology, the modern Crux is referred to as <i>Trishanku</i>.</p>
<p>In Indonesia and Malaysia, it is known as <i>Buruj Pari</i> (the constellation of the Stingray).</p>
<p>The Javanese people of Indonesia called this constellation <i>Gubug pèncèng</i> ("raking hut") or <i>lumbung</i> ("the granary"), because the shape of the constellation was like a raking hut.</p>
<p>The Māori name for the Southern Cross is <i>Te Punga</i> ("the anchor"). It is thought of as the anchor of Tama-rereti's <i>waka</i> (the Milky Way), while the Pointers are its rope.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>In Mapudungun, the language of Patagonian Mapuches, the name of the Southern Cross is <i>Melipal</i>, which means "four stars". In Quechua, the language of the Inca civilization, Crux is known as "Chakana", which means literally "stair" (<i>chaka</i>, bridge, link; <i>hanan</i>, high, above), but carries a deep symbolism within Quechua mysticism.</p>
<p>In Samoa the constellation is called <i>Sumu</i> ("triggerfish") because of its rhomboid shape, while α and β Centauri are called <i>Luatagata</i> (Two Men), just as they are in Tonga.</p>
<p>In Tonga it is known as <i>Toloa</i> ("duck"); it is depicted as a duck flying south, with one of his wings (δ Crucis) wounded because <i>Ongo tangata</i> ("two men", α and β Centauri) threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as <i>Humu</i> (the "triggerfish"), because of its shape.</p>
<p>Among Tuaregs, the four most visible stars of Crux are considered <i>iggaren</i>, i.e. four <i>Maerua crassifolia</i> trees.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>The Tswana people of Botswana saw the constellation as <i>Dithutlwa</i>, two giraffes - Acrux and Mimosa forming a male, and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.</p>
<p>Acrux and Mimosa make up one foot of the Great Rhea, a constellation encompassing Centaurus and Circinus along with the two bright stars. The Great Rhea was a constellation of the Bororo people of Brazil. The Mocoví people of Argentina also saw a rhea including the stars of Crux. Their rhea is attacked by two dogs, represented by bright stars in Centaurus and Circinus. The dogs' heads are marked by Alpha and Beta Centauri. The rhea's body is marked by the four main stars of Crux, while its head is Gamma Centauri and its feet are the bright stars of Musca.</p>
<p>The Bakairi people of Brazil had a sprawling constellation representing a bird snare. It included the bright stars of Crux, the southern part of Centaurus, Circinus, at least one star in Lupus, the bright stars of Musca, Beta and Delta Chamaeleonis, Volans, and Mensa.</p>
<p>The peoples of the Solomon Islands saw several figures in the Southern Cross. These included a knee protector and a net used to catch Palolo worms. Neighboring peoples in the Marshall Islands and Samoa saw these stars as a fish.</p>
<p>Various peoples in the East Indies and Brazil viewed the four main stars as the body of a ray.</p>
<p>Two Pacific constellations also included Gamma Centauri. Torres Strait Islanders in modern-day Australia saw Gamma Centauri as the handle and the four stars as the trident of Tagai's Fishing Spear. The Aranda people of central Australia saw the four Cross stars as the talon of an eagle and Gamma Centauri as its leg.</p>
<h3> In popular culture</h3>
<p>Argentine Gauchos are well known for using it for night orientation in the vast Pampas and Patagonic regions. It is also of cultural significance, as it is referenced in several songs and literature, including the Martin Fierro. The Argentinian singer Charly Garcia says that he is from the southern cross in the song "No voy en tren".</p>
<p>The Argentine Air Force acrobatic display team is called <i>Cruz del Sur</i>, the Spanish for "Southern Cross".</p>
<p>In the <i>Victory At Sea</i> suite, Richard Rodgers wrote "Beneath The Southern Cross" to depict the battleships in convoy and the loneliness of the sailors in the Southern Pacific during World War II.
