<h1>Cancer (constellation)</h1>
<p><b>Cancer</b> is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for crab and it is commonly represented as such. Its astrological symbol is [Cancer.svg] (Unicode ♋). Cancer is relatively small among the constellations with an area of only 505 square degrees and its stars are rather faint. It lies between Gemini to the west and Leo to the east, Lynx to the north and Canis Minor and Hydra to the south.</p>
<h2> Notable features</h2>

<h3> Named stars</h3>
<p>Cancer is the dimmest of the zodiacal constellations, having only two stars above the fourth magnitude.</p>
<ul><li><b>α Cnc (Acubens)</b> is a double star with a primary of magnitude 4.3, 173 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 12.0 and is visible in small amateur telescopes. Its common name means "the claw".</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>β Cnc</b> <b>(Altarf)</b> is the brightest star in Cancer at magnitude 3.5. It is an orange-hued binary star system consisting of a K-type orange giant and a red dwarf located 290 light-years from Earth. Altarf represents a part of Cancer's body. </li>
</ul><ul><li><b>γ Cnc (Asellus Borealis)</b> is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.7, 158 light-years from Earth. Its common name means "northern donkey".</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>δ Cnc (Asellus Australis)</b> is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.9, 136 light-years from Earth. Its common name means "southern donkey".</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>ζ Cnc</b> is a multiple star system 83 light-years from Earth. The two brightest components are a binary star with an orbital period of 1100 years; the brighter component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 70000.0 and the dimmer component is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 6.2. The brighter component is itself a binary star with a period of 59.5 years; its primary is of magnitude 5.6 and its secondary is of magnitude 6.0. This pair will be at its greatest separation in 2018.</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>ι Cnc</b> is a wide double star. The primary is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 4.0, 298 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.6.</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>55 Cnc</b> has a quintuple planet system with one super-earth and four gas giants, one of which is in the habitable zone and as of such has expected temperatures similar to Earth.</li>
</ul><h3> Deep-sky objects</h3>
<p>Cancer is best known among stargazers as the home of Praesepe (Messier 44), an open cluster also called the <i>Beehive Cluster</i>, 577 light-years from Earth. M44 contains about 50 stars, the brightest of which are of the sixth magnitude. ε Cnc is the brightest member at magnitude 6.3. Praesepe is also one of the larger open clusters visible; it has an area of 1.5 square degrees, or three times the size of the full Moon.</p>
<p>The smaller, denser open cluster Messier 67 can also be found in Cancer, 2500 light-years from Earth. It has an area of approximately 0.5 square degrees, the size of the full Moon. It contains approximately 200 stars, the brightest of which are of the tenth magnitude.</p>
<h2> History</h2>
<p>Cancer is said to have been the place for the Akkadian Sun of the South, perhaps from its position at the summer solstice in very remote antiquity. But afterwards it was associated with the fourth month <i>Duzu</i> (June–July in the modern western calendar), and was known as the Northern Gate of Sun.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>Showing but few stars, and its brightest stars being of only 4th magnitude, Cancer was often considered the "Dark Sign", quaintly described as black and without eyes. Dante, alluding to this faintness and position of heavens, wrote in <i>Paradiso</i>:</p>
<p>Cancer was the location of the Sun's most northerly position in the sky (the summer solstice) in ancient times, though this position now occurs in Taurus due to the precession of the equinoxes, around June 21. This is also the time that the sun is directly overhead at 23.5°N, a parallel now known as the Tropic of Cancer.</p>
<h2> Illustrations</h2>

<p>The modern symbol for Cancer represents the pincers of a crab, but Cancer has been represented as various types of creatures, usually those living in the water, and always those with an exoskeleton.</p>
<p>In the Egyptian records of about 2000 BC it was described as Scarabaeus (Scarab), the sacred emblem of immortality. In Babylonia the constellation was known as MUL.AL.LUL, a name which can refer to both a crab and a snapping turtle. On boundary stones, the image of a turtle or tortoise appears quite regularly and it is believed that this represent Cancer as a conventional crab has not so far been discovered on any of these monuments. There also appears to be a strong connection between the Babylonian constellation and ideas of death and a passage to the underworld, which may be the origin of these ideas in much later Greek myths associated with Hercules and the Hydra. In the 12th century, an illustrated astronomical manuscript shows it as a water beetle. Albumasar writes of this sign in the work published in 1489 as a large crayfish. Jakob Bartsch and Stanislaus Lubienitzki, in the 17th century, described it as a lobster.</p>
<h2> Names</h2>
<p>In Ancient Greece, Aratus called the crab <i>Καρκινος</i> (<i>Karkinos</i>), which was followed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. The Alfonsine tables called it <i>Carcinus</i>, a Latinized form of the Greek word. Eratosthenes extended this as <i>Καρκινος</i>, <i>Ονοι</i>, <i>και Φατνη</i>: the Crab, Asses, and Crib.</p>
<p>The Indian language Sanskrit shares a common ancestor with Greek, and the Sanskrit name of Cancer is <i>Karka</i> and <i>Karkata</i>. In Telugu it is "Karkatakam", in Kannada "Karkataka" or "Kataka", in Tamil <i>Karkatan</i>, and in Sinhalese <i>Kagthaca</i>. The later Hindus knew it as <i>Kulira</i>, from the Greek <i>Κολουρος</i> (<i>Koloyros</i>), the term originated by Proclus.</p>
<p>In Ancient Rome, Manilius and Ovid called the constellation <i>Litoreus</i> (shore-inhabiting). <i>Astacus</i> and <i>Cammarus</i> appear in various classic writers, while it is called <i>Nepa</i> in Cicero's <i>De Finibus</i> and the works of Columella, Plautus, and Varro; all of these words signify crab, lobster, or scorpion.</p>
<p>Athanasius Kircher said that in Coptic Egypt it was <i>Κλαρια</i>, the <i>Bestia seu Statio Typhonis</i> (the Power of Darkness). Jérôme Lalande identified this with Anubis<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>, one of the Egyptian divinities commonly associated with Sirius.</p>
<h2> Mythology</h2>

<p>The creation of the constellation is explained in Greek mythology by the short-lived association of Karkinos with one of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, in which Hercules battled the multi-headed Lernaean Hydra. Hera had sent Karkinos to distract Hercules and put him at a disadvantage during the battle, but Hercules quickly dispatched the creature by kicking it with such force that it was propelled into the sky. Other accounts had Karkinos grabbing onto Hercules' toe with its claws, but Hercules simply crushed the crab underfoot. Hera, grateful for Karkinos' heroic effort, gave it a place in the sky. Some scholars have suggested that Karkinos was a late addition to the myth of Hercules in order to make the Twelve Labors correspond to the twelve signs of the Zodiac.</p>
<h3> Astrology</h3>

<p>As of 2002<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;">[update]</sup>, the Sun appears in the constellation Cancer from July 21 to August 9. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Cancer from June 21 to July 21, and in sidereal astrology, from July 16 to August 15.</p>
<h2> Equivalents</h2>
<p>In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Cancer lie within the The Vermillion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, <i>Nán Fāng Zhū Què</i>).</p>
<h2> Popular culture</h2>
<p>In the 1998 Sega arcade game <i>The Ocean Hunter,</i> Karkinos is featured therein as one of seven boss characters. Though Karkinos is depicted in the game as resembling a giant red king crab, its species is listed therein as <i>Macrocheira kaempferi</i>, or the Japanese spider crab.</p>
<p>In the final book in the <i>Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians</i> series, <i>The Last Olympian</i>, Percy Jackson fights a giant crab (Karkinos) on board the Titan cruise ship <i>Princess Andromeda</i>. He kills it by stabbing its underbelly, its only uncovered, vulnerable point.</p>
