<h1>Spanish language</h1>
<p><b>Spanish</b> (<i>español</i>), also called <b>Castilian</b> (<i>castellano</i> [About this sound] listen<small class="metadata audiolinkinfo" style="cursor:help;"> (help·info)</small>), is a Romance language that originated in Castile, a region in Spain. There are approximately 405 million people speaking Spanish as a native language, making it the second-most-spoken language by number of native speakers after Mandarin. Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and is used as an official language by the European Union and Mercosur.</p>
<p>Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group that evolved from several dialects of spoken Latin in central-northern Iberia around the ninth century and gradually spread with the expansion of the Kingdom of Castile (present northern Spain) into central and southern Iberia during the later Middle Ages. Early in its history, the Spanish vocabulary was enriched by its contact with Basque, Arabic and related Iberian Romance languages, and the language continues to adopt foreign words from a variety of other languages, as well as developing new words. Spanish was taken most notably to the Americas as well as to Africa and Asia-Pacific with the expansion of the Spanish Empire between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, where it became the most important language for government and trade.</p>
<p>Spanish is the most popular second language learned by native speakers of American English. In many other countries as well, in the 21st century, the learning of Spanish as a foreign language has grown significantly, facilitated in part because of the growing population demographics and economic performance of numerous Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico. Growing popularity in extensive international tourism and seeking less expensive retirement destinations for North Americans, Europeans, Australians, and Japanese are other common reasons.</p>
<p>Spanish is the most widely understood language in the Western Hemisphere, with significant populations of native Spanish speakers ranging from the tip of Patagonia to as far north as New York City and Chicago. Additionally, there are over 10,000,000 fluent second language speakers in both Brazil and the United States. Since the early 21st century, it has arguably superseded French in becoming the second-most-studied language and the second language in international communication, after English.</p>
<h2> Names of the language</h2>


<p>In Spain and in some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called <i>castellano</i> (Castilian) as well as <i>español</i> (Spanish), that is, the language of the region of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician, Basque, and Catalan. Speakers of these regional languages prefer the term <i>castellano</i>, as they consider their own languages equally "Spanish". The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term <i>castellano</i> to define the official language of the whole Spanish State, in contrast to <i>las demás lenguas españolas</i> (lit. <i>the rest of the Spanish languages</i>). Article III reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">

</blockquote>
<p>The Spanish Royal Academy, on the other hand, currently uses the term <i>español</i> in its publications but from 1713 to 1923 called the language <i>castellano</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Diccionario panhispánico de dudas</i> (a language guide published by the Spanish Royal Academy) states that, although the Spanish Royal Academy prefers to use the term <i>español</i> in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms, <i>español</i> and <i>castellano</i>, are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.</p>
<p>The name <i>castellano</i> is preferred in all of Spanish-speaking South America except Colombia. The term <i>español</i> is more commonly used to refer to the language as a whole when relating to a global context.</p>
<p>Two etymologies for <i>español</i> have been suggested. The Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary derives the term from the Provençal word <i>espaignol</i>, and that in turn from the Medieval Latin word <i>Hispaniolus</i>, 'from—or pertaining to—Hispania'. Other authorities attribute it to a supposed medieval Latin *<i>hispaniōne</i>, with the same meaning.</p>
<h2> History</h2>


<p>The Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin (colloquial Latin), which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 B.C. Prior to that time, several pre-Roman languages (also called Paleohispanic languages)—unrelated to Latin, and some of them unrelated even to Indo-European—were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included Basque (still spoken today), Iberian, and Celtiberian. Traces of these languages can be found in the Spanish vocabulary today, especially among place names.</p>
<p>The first documents regarded as precursors of modern Spanish are thought to be from the ninth century (see <i>Glosas Emilianenses</i>). Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era the Spanish (Castilian) lexicon absorbed vocabulary, not only from the neighboring Romance languages—such as Navarro-Aragonese, Leonese, Aragonese, Catalan, Portuguese, Galician, Mirandese, Occitan, Gascon, French, and Italian—but also from Arabic, Basque, and Germanic languages. Many words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church.</p>
<p>Some local versions of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish in the north of Iberia, in an area defined by Álava, Cantabria, Burgos, Soria and La Rioja, within the Kingdom of Castile. Several features of these dialects are thought to have been brought later to the dialect spoken in the city of Toledo, where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century. In this formative stage, Spanish (Castilian) developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, Leonese, and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see Iberian Romance languages). This distinctive dialect progressively spread south with the advance of the <i>Reconquista</i>, and so gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al-Andalus, especially in the later medieval period. The written standard for this new language began to be developed in the cities of Toledo (13th to 16th centuries) and Madrid (from the 1570s).</p>
<p>The development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages, including lenition of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin vīta &gt; Spanish <i>vida</i>). The diphthongization of Latin stressed short e and o—which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese—is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Spanish is marked by the palatalization of the Latin double consonants nn and ll (thus Latin annum &gt; Spanish <i>año</i>, and Latin anellum &gt; Spanish <i>anillo</i>).</p>
<p>The consonant written ⟨u⟩ or ⟨v⟩ in Latin and pronounced [w] in Classical Latin had probably "fortified" to a bilabial fricative /β/ in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written ⟨b⟩ (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩.</p>
<p>Peculiar to Spanish (as well as to the neighboring Gascon dialect of Occitan, and sometimes attributed to a Basque substratum) was the mutation of Latin initial f- into <i>h-</i> whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The <i>h-</i>, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects it is still aspirated in some words. This is the reason why there are modern spelling variants <i>Fernando</i> and <i>Hernando</i> (both Spanish of "Ferdinand"), <i>ferrero</i> and <i>herrero</i> (both Spanish of "smith"), <i>fierro</i> and <i>hierro</i> (both Spanish of "iron"), and <i>fondo</i> and <i>hondo</i> (both Spanish of "deep", but <i>fondo</i> means "bottom" while <i>hondo</i> means "deep"); <i>hacer</i> (Spanish of "to make") is the root word of <i>satisfacer</i> (Spanish of "to satisfy"), and <i>hecho</i> ("made") is the root word of <i>satisfecho</i> (Spanish of "satisfied").</p>
<p>Compare the examples in the following table:</p>
<p>Some consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages, as shown in the examples in the following table:</p>
<p>In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants, known in Spanish as the <i>reajuste de las sibilantes</i>, which resulted in the distinctive velar [x] pronunciation of the letter ⟨j⟩ and—in a large part of Spain—the characteristic interdental [θ] ("th-sound") for the letter ⟨z⟩ (and for ⟨c⟩ before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩). See History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants) for details.</p>


<p>The <i>Gramática de la lengua castellana</i>, written in Salamanca in 1492 by Elio Antonio de Nebrija, was the first grammar written for a modern European language. According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I, she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire. In his introduction to the grammar, dated August 18, 1492, Nebrija wrote that "... language was always the companion of empire."</p>
<p>From the sixteenth century onwards, the language was taken to America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America. Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, author of Don Quixote, is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called <i>la lengua de Cervantes</i> ("the language of Cervantes").</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara, and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as Spanish Harlem in New York City. For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see Influences on the Spanish language.</p>
<h2> Grammar</h2>

<p>Spanish is a relatively inflected language, with a two-gender noun system and about fifty conjugated forms per verb, but with inflection of nouns, adjectives, and determiners limited to number and gender. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs.)</p>
<p>Spanish syntax is considered right-branching, meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses prepositions (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case), and usually—though not always—places adjectives after nouns, as do most other Romance languages. Its sentence structure is generally subject–verb–object, although variations are common. It is a "pro-drop", or "null-subject" language—that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary. Spanish is described as a "verb-framed" language, meaning that the <i>direction</i> of motion is expressed in the verb while the <i>mode</i> of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. <i>subir corriendo</i> or <i>salir volando</i>; the respective English equivalents of these examples—'to run up' and 'to fly out'—show that English is, by contrast, "satellite-framed", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).</p>
<h2> Phonology</h2>

<h3> Segmental phonology</h3>
<p>The Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect). The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels /i/ and /u/ to glides—[j] and [w] respectively—when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels /e/ and /o/, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs [je] and [we] respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.</p>
<p>The Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three nasal phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) lateral phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant; (2) three voiceless stops and the affricate /tʃ/; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) voiceless fricatives; (4) a set of voiced obstruents—/b/, /d/, /ɡ/, and sometimes /ʝ/—which alternate between fricative and plosive allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the "tapped" and "trilled" <i>r</i>-sounds (single ⟨r⟩ and double ⟨rr⟩ in orthography).</p>
<p>In the following table of consonant phonemes, /θ/ and /ʎ/ are marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that they are preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects they have been merged, respectively, with /s/ and /ʝ/, in the mergers called, respectively, <i>seseo</i> and <i>yeísmo</i>. The phoneme /ʃ/ is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in loanwords. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes /b/, /d/, /ʝ/, and /ɡ/ appears to the right of a <i>pair</i> of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the <i>voiceless</i> phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the <i>voiced</i> ones alternate allophonically (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and fricative pronunciations.</p>
<dl><dt><i>V</i> and <i>B</i></dt>
</dl><p>The letters ⟨v⟩ and ⟨b⟩ normally represent the same phoneme, /b/, which is realized as [b] after a nasal consonant or a pause, and as [β] elsewhere, as in [embaɾaˈθaɾ] <i>embarazar</i>, and [moˈβeɾ] <i>mover</i>. The Royal Spanish Academy considers the /v/ pronunciation for the letter ⟨v⟩ to be incorrect and affected. However, some Spanish speakers maintain the pronunciation of the /v/ sound as it is in other western European languages. The sound /v/ is used for the letter ⟨v⟩, in the Spanish language, by a few second-language speakers in Spain whose native language is Catalan, in the Balearic Islands, in the Valencian Community, and in southern Catalonia. In the USA it is also common due to the proximity and influence of English phonology, and the /v/ is also occasionally used in Mexico. Some parts of Central America also use /v/, which the Royal Academy attributes to the interference of local indigenous languages.</p>
<p>Historically, the /v/ pronunciation was uncommon, but considered correct well into the twentieth century.</p>
<h3> Prosody</h3>
<p>Spanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable-timed language, meaning that each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.</p>
<p>Spanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect, but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.), and rising tone for yes/no questions. Subject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.</p>
<p>Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-last or earlier syllables. The <i>tendencies</i> of stress assignment are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.</li>
<li>In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings <i>-n</i> (for third-person-plural of verbs) and <i>-s</i> (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus regular <i>verbs</i> ending with <i>-n</i> and the great majority of words ending with <i>-s</i> are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with <i>-n</i> are also stressed on the penult (e.g. <i>joven</i>, <i>virgen</i>, <i>mitin</i>), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with <i>-n</i> are stressed on their last syllable (e.g. <i>capitán</i>, <i>almacén</i>, <i>jardín</i>, <i>corazón</i>).</li>
<li>Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, and only on verbs with clitic pronouns attached (e.g. <i>guardándoselos</i> 'saving them for him/her/them').</li>
</ul><p>In addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous minimal pairs which contrast solely on stress such as <i>sábana</i> ('sheet') and <i>sabana</i> ('savannah'), as well as <i>límite</i> ('boundary'), <i>limite</i> ('[that] he/she limits') and <i>limité</i> ('I limited'), or also <i>líquido</i> ('liquid'), <i>liquido</i> ('I sell off') and <i>liquidó</i> ('he/she sold off').</p>
<p>The spelling system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is ⟨n⟩, ⟨s⟩, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last syllable; if and only if the absence of an accent mark would give the wrong stress information, an acute accent mark appears over the stressed syllable.</p>
<h2> Geographical distribution</h2>


<p>Spanish is the primary language of 20 countries worldwide. It is estimated that the combined total number of Spanish speakers is between 470 and 500 million, making it the second most widely spoken language in terms of native speakers. Spanish is the third most spoken language by total number of speakers (after Mandarin and English). Internet usage statistics for 2007 show Spanish as the third most commonly used language on the Internet, after English and Mandarin.</p>
<h3> Europe</h3>

<p>In Europe, Spanish is an official language of Spain, the country after which it is named and from which it originated. It is widely spoken in Gibraltar, although English is the official language. It is also commonly spoken in Andorra, although Catalan is the official language. Spanish is also spoken by small communities in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Spanish is an official language of the European Union. In Switzerland, Spanish is the native language of 1.7% of the population, representing the largest minority after the 4 official languages of the country.</p>
<p>Spanish is the fourth most widely studied second language in Western Europe after English, French, and German.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> In France and the United Kingdom Spanish is often the second most popular foreign language (after English and French respectively).<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<h3> The Americas</h3>
<h4> Latin America</h4>

<p>Most Spanish speakers are in Latin America; of all countries with a majority of Spanish speakers, only Spain and Equatorial Guinea are outside the Americas. Mexico has the most native speakers of any country. Nationally, Spanish is the official language—either <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure</i>—of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, Peru (in addition to Spanish; Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages are also official in areas where they predominate), Bolivia (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, Guarani and 34 other languages), Paraguay (co-official with Guaraní). Spanish is also the de facto and official language in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize; however, per the 2000 census, it is spoken by 43% of the population. Mainly, it is spoken by the descendants of Hispanics who have been in the region since the seventeenth century; however, English is the official language.</p>
<p>Spain colonized Trinidad and Tobago first in 1498, introducing the Spanish language to the Carib people. Also the Cocoa Panyols, laborers from Venezuela, took their culture and language with them; they are accredited with the music of "Parang" ("Parranda") on the island. Because of Trinidad's location on the South American coast, the country is greatly influenced by its Spanish-speaking neighbors. A recent census shows that more than 1,500 inhabitants speak Spanish. In 2004, the government launched the <i>Spanish as a First Foreign Language</i> (SAFFL) initiative in March 2005. Government regulations require Spanish to be taught, beginning in primary school, while thirty percent of public employees are to be linguistically competent within five years.</p>
<p>Spanish is important in Brazil because of its proximity to and increased trade with its Spanish-speaking neighbors, and because of its membership in the Mercosur trading bloc and the Union of South American Nations. In 2005, the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill, signed into law by the President, making Spanish language teaching mandatory in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil. In many border towns and villages (especially in the Uruguayan-Brazilian and Paraguayan-Brazilian border areas), a mixed language known as Portuñol is spoken.</p>
<h4> United States</h4>


<p>According to 2006 census data, 44.3 million people of the U.S. population were Hispanic or Latin American by origin; 34 million people, 12.2 percent, of the population more than five years old speak Spanish at home. Spanish has a long history in the United States because many southwestern states were Spanish territories, and subsequently part of Mexico. In the southeast, Florida was a Spanish territory until 1821. The language recently has been revitalized in the U.S. by an influx of Hispanic immigrants. Spanish is the most widely taught language in the country after English. Although the United States has no formally designated "official languages," Spanish is formally recognized at the state level in various states in addition to English. In the U.S. state of New Mexico, 40% of the population speaks the language. It also has strong influence in metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, Miami, San Antonio, New York City, Tampa, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Chicago, and in the twenty-first century the language has rapidly expanded in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Washington, DC. With a total of 37 million Spanish speakers, according to US Census Bureau, the U.S. has the world's second-largest Spanish-speaking population. Spanish ranks second, behind English, as the language spoken most widely at home.</p>
<h3> Africa</h3>
<p>In Africa, Spanish is official in Equatorial Guinea (co-official with French and Portuguese), as well as an official language of the African Union. In Equatorial Guinea, Spanish is the predominant language when native and non-native speakers (around 500,000 people) are counted, while Fang is the most spoken language by number of native speakers.</p>
<p>Today, in Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, an unknown number of Sahrawis are able to read and write in Spanish, and several thousands have received university education in foreign countries as part of aid packages (mainly in Cuba and Spain).<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>Sahrawi Press Service, the official news service of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic of Western Sahara, has been available in Spanish since 2001, and RASD TV, the official television channel of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, has a website available in Spanish. The Sahara Film Festival, Western Sahara's only film festival, mainly shows Spanish-language films. Spanish is used to document Sahrawi poetry and oral traditions and has also be used in Sahrawi literature. Despite Spanish having been used by the Sahrawi people for over a century due to Western Sahara's history as a former Spanish colony, the Cervantes Institute has denied support and Spanish-language education to Sahrawis in Western Sahara and the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria. A group of Sahrawi poets known as <i>Generación de la Amistad saharaui</i> produces Sahrawi literature in Spanish.</p>
<p>Spanish is also spoken in the Spanish autonomous cities of Ceuta (75,241) and Melilla (73,460) in continental North Africa, and in the autonomous community of the Canary Islands (2,117,519), a Spanish archipelago located just off the northwest coast of mainland Africa. Within Northern Morocco, a former Spanish protectorate that is also geographically close to Spain, approximately 20,000 people speak Spanish as a second language. A small number of Moroccan Jews speak the Sephardic Spanish dialect Haketia (related to the Ladino dialect spoken in Israel). Spanish is spoken by some communities in Angola because of the Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned in time for their country's independence.</p>
<h3> Asia-Pacific</h3>


<p>Spanish was used by the colonial governments and the educated classes in the former Spanish East Indies, namely the Philippines, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. From 1565 to 1973 it was an official language of the Philippines. Up to 1899 it was the language of government, trade and education, and spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos. In the mid-nineteenth century the colonial government set up a free public school system with Spanish as the medium of instruction. This increased the use of Spanish throughout the islands and led to a class of Spanish-speaking intellectuals called the <i>Ilustrados</i>. Although Spanish never became the language of a majority of the population, Philippine literature and press primarily used Spanish up to the 1940s. It continued as an official language until the change of Constitution in 1973. Following the U.S. occupation and administration of the islands in 1899, the American government increasingly imposed English, especially after the 1920s. The US authorities conducted a campaign of introducing English as the medium of instruction in schools, universities and public spaces, and prohibited the use of Spanish in media and educational institutions.</p>
<p>After the country became independent in 1946, Spanish remained an official language along with English and Tagalog-based Filipino. However, the language lost its official status in 1973 during the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. In 2007, the Arroyo administration announced that it would pass legislation to reintroduce Spanish in the Philippine education system. In 2010, a Memorandum was signed between Spanish and Philippine authorities to cooperate in implementing this decree. Despite government promotions of Spanish, less than 0.5% of the population speak Spanish as a native language. The number of Spanish speakers in the Philippines continues to see a decline, although at a lesser rate than previous decades. Worthy of mention however, is Chavacano, a Spanish-Based Creole Language or Creole Spanish Language and also known as Philippine Creole Spanish, spoken by 600,000 people as of the year 2000 both in the Philippines and Sabah.</p>
<p>The local languages of the Philippines retain much Spanish influence, with many words being derived from Spanish from Spain and Mexican Spanish, due to the control of the islands by Spain through Mexico City until 1821, and directly from Madrid until 1898.</p>
<p>Among the countries and territories in Oceania, Spanish is also spoken in Easter Island, a territorial possession of Chile. The U.S. Territories of Guam and Northern Marianas, and the independent states of Palau, Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia all once had majority Spanish speakers, since the Marianas and the Caroline Islands were Spanish colonial possessions until the late nineteenth century (see Spanish-American War). Spanish is no longer used by the masses, but there are still native and second-language speakers. It also exists as an influence on the local native languages as many Spanish loan words still exist in that part of the world. In fact, over 9% of foreign loanwords in the Palaun language can be traced back to Spanish. Additionally, it is also spoken by Hispanic American resident populations.</p>
<h3> Antarctica</h3>
<p>The Antarctic Treaty regulates international relations with respect to Antarctica. Argentina and Chile, both Spanish-speaking countries, claim territories according to this treaty. The Argentine Antarctica sector had a winter population of 169 in 1999, and in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, according to the national census of 2002, the population was 130 (115 male, 15 female).</p>
<h3> Spanish speakers by country</h3>
<p>The following table shows the number of Spanish speakers in some 70 countries.</p>
<h2> Dialectal variation</h2>

<p>There are important variations—phonological, grammatical, and lexical—in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.</p>
<p>The variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.</p>
<p>In Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as yeísmo and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television, and is the variety that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.</p>
<h3> Phonology</h3>
<p>Three of the main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme /θ/ ("theta"), (2) the phoneme /ʎ/ ("turned <i>y</i>"), and (3) the "debuccalization" (also frequently called "aspiration") of syllable-final /s/. The phoneme /θ/ (spelled ⟨z⟩, or ⟨c⟩ before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩)—a voiceless dental fricative as in English <i><b>th</b>ing</i>—is maintained in northern and central Spain, but is merged with the sibilant /s/ in southern Spain, the Canary Islands, and all of American Spanish. This merger is called <i>seseo</i> in Spanish. The phoneme /ʎ/ (spelled ⟨ll⟩)—a palatal lateral consonant sometimes compared in sound to the <i>lli</i> of English <i>million</i>—tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in highland areas of South America, but in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers it is merged with /ʝ/ ("curly-tail <i>j</i>")—a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant—sometimes compared to English /j/ (<i>yod</i>) as in <i>yacht</i>, and spelled <i>y</i> in Spanish. This merger is called <i>yeísmo</i> in Spanish. And the debuccalization (pronunciation as [h], or loss) of syllable-final /s/ is associated with southern Spain, the Caribbean, and coastal areas of South America.</p>
<h3> Grammar</h3>
<p>The main grammatical variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns: especially those of the second person and, to a lesser extent, the object pronouns of the third person.</p>
<h4> Voseo</h4>


<p>Virtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second-person singular, and thus have two different pronouns meaning "you": <i>usted</i> in the formal, and either <i>tú</i> or <i>vos</i> in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of <i>tú</i> or <i>vos</i> varying from one dialect to another. The use of <i>vos</i> (and/or its verb forms) is called <i>voseo</i>. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used—<i>usted</i>, <i>tú</i>, and <i>vos</i>—denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.</p>
<p>In <i>voseo</i>, <i>vos</i> is the subject form (<i>vos decís</i>, "you say") and the form for the object of a preposition (<i>voy con vos</i>, "I'm going with you"), while the direct and indirect object forms, and the possessives, are the same as those associated with <i>tú</i>: <i>Vos sabés que tus amigos te respetan</i> ("You know your friends respect you"). Additional examples: "<i>Vos te acostaste con el tuerto</i>" (Gené Ulf [Arg. 1988]); "<i>Lugar que odio</i> [...] <i>como te odio a vos</i>" (Rossi María [C. Rica 1985]); "<i>No cerrés tus ojos</i>" (Flores Siguamonta [Guat. 1993]).</p>
<p>The verb forms of <i>general voseo</i> are the same as those used with <i>tú</i> except in the present tense (indicative and subjunctive) verbs. The forms for <i>vos</i> generally can be derived from those of <i>vosotros</i> (the traditional second-person familiar <i>plural</i>) by deleting the glide /j/ where it appears in the ending: <i>vosotros pensá<b>i</b>s</i> &gt; <i>vos pensás</i>; <i>vosotros queré<b>i</b>s</i> &gt; <i>vos querés</i>.</p>
<p>In Chilean <i>voseo</i> on the other hand, almost all verb forms are distinct from their standard <i>tú</i>-forms.</p>
<p>The use of the pronoun <i>vos</i> with the verb forms of <i>tú</i> (e.g. <i>vos piensas</i>) is called "pronominal <i>voseo</i>". And conversely, the use of the verb forms of <i>vos</i> with the pronoun <i>tú</i> (e.g. <i>tú pensás</i> or <i>tú pensái</i>) is called "verbal <i>voseo</i>".<br>
In Chile, for example, <i>verbal voseo</i> is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun <i>vos</i> which is often reserved for deeply informal situations.</p>
<dl><dt>Distribution in Spanish America</dt>
</dl>
<p>Although <i>vos</i> is not used in Spain, in large areas of Spanish America it occurs as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, although with wide differences in social consideration. Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of <i>tuteo</i> in the following areas: almost all of Mexico, the West Indies, Panama, most of Peru and Venezuela, coastal Ecuador and the Pacific coast of Colombia.</p>
<p><i>Tuteo</i> (the use of <i>tú</i>) as a cultured form alternates with <i>voseo</i> as a popular or rural form in Bolivia, in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers claim that <i>voseo</i> can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, while others assert that it is absent from the island.</p>
<p><i>Tuteo</i> exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar <i>voseo</i> in Chile, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, on the Pacific coast of Colombia, in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and in parts of Guatemala.</p>
<p>Areas of generalized <i>voseo</i> include Argentina, Costa Rica, eastern Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Valle del Cauca, Risaralda, Caldas and Antioquia.</p>
<h4> Ustedes</h4>
<p>The second person plural maintains the formal/familiar distinction with <i>ustedes</i> and <i>vosotros</i> respectively in most of Spain, but in areas of Andalusia, in the Canary Islands, and in all of Spanish America, both functions are merged in the use of <i>ustedes</i>, regardless of familiarity. In Seville, Cadiz, and other parts of western Andalusia, the familiar form is constructed as <i>ustedes vais</i>, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb.</p>
<h4> Usted</h4>
<p><i>Usted</i> is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, used to portray respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority ("you, sir"/"you, ma'am"). It is also used in a <i>familiar</i> context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica, and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of <i>tú</i> or <i>vos</i>. This usage is sometimes called <i>ustedeo</i> in Spanish.</p>
<p>In Central America, especially in Honduras, <i>usted</i> is often used as a formal pronoun to portray respect between the members of a romantic couple. <i>Usted</i> is also used in this way, as well as between parents and children, in the Andean regions of Colombia and Venezuela.</p>
<h4> Third-person object pronouns</h4>
<p>Most speakers use (and the <i>Real Academia Española</i> prefers) the pronouns <i>lo</i> and <i>la</i> for <i>direct</i> objects (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of animacy, meaning "him", "her", or "it"), and <i>le</i> for <i>indirect</i> objects (regardless of gender or animacy, meaning "to him", "to her", or "to it"). This usage is sometimes called "etymological", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.</p>
<p>Deviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called "<i>leísmo</i>", "<i>loísmo</i>", or "<i>laísmo</i>", according to which respective pronoun—<i>le</i>, <i>lo</i>, or <i>la</i>—has expanded beyond the etymological usage (i.e. <i>le</i> as a direct object, or <i>lo</i> or <i>la</i> as an indirect object).</p>
<h3> Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Some words can be different, even significantly so, in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms, even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish <i>mantequilla</i>, <i>aguacate</i> and <i>albaricoque</i> (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to <i>manteca</i>, <i>palta</i>, and <i>damasco</i>, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except <i>manteca</i>), Paraguay, Peru (except <i>manteca</i> and <i>damasco</i>), and Uruguay. The everyday Spanish words <i>coger</i> ('to take'), <i>pisar</i> ('to step on') and <i>concha</i> ('seashell') are considered extremely rude in parts of Latin America, where the meaning of <i>coger</i> and <i>pisar</i> is also "to have sex" and <i>concha</i> means "vulva". The Puerto Rican word for "bobby pin" (<i>pinche</i>) is an obscenity in Mexico, but in Nicaragua it simply means "stingy", and in Spain refers to a chef's helper. Other examples include <i>taco</i>, which means "swearword" (among other meanings) in Spain, "traffic jam" in Chile and "heels" (shoe) in Peru but is known to the rest of the world as a Mexican dish. <i>Pija</i> in many countries of Latin America and Spain itself is an obscene slang word for "penis", while in Spain the word also signifies "posh girl" or "snobby". <i>Coche</i>, which means "car" in Spain, central Mexico and Argentina, for the vast majority of Spanish-speakers actually means "baby-stroller" or "pushchair", while <i>carro</i> means "car" in some Latin American countries and "cart" in others, as well as in Spain. Papaya is the slang term for "vagina" in parts of Cuba and Venezuela, where the fruit is instead called <i>fruta bomba</i> and <i>lechosa</i>, respectively. Also, in Argentina, one would say "piña" when talking about 'punching' someone else, whereas in other countries, "piña" refers to a pineapple.</p>
<h2> Relation to other languages</h2>

<p>Spanish is closely related to the other Iberian Romance languages: Asturian, Aragonese, Catalan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Mirandese and Portuguese. Spanish language has many borrowings from others Iberian Romance languages and Italian and French languages have contributed in vocabulary too.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although Portuguese and Spanish are very closely related, particularly in vocabulary (89% lexically similar according to the Ethnologue of Languages), syntax and grammar, there are also some differences that don't exist between Catalan and Portuguese. Although Spanish and Portuguese are widely considered to be mutually intelligible, it has been noted that while most Portuguese speakers can understand spoken Spanish with little difficulty, Spanish speakers face more difficulty in understanding spoken Portuguese. The written forms are considered to be equally intelligible, however.</p>
<h3> Vocabulary comparison</h3>
<p>At present, the lexical similarity with Italian is estimated at 82%. The lexical similarity with Portuguese is greater at 89%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or Romanian is lower (lexical similarity being respectively 75% and 71%): comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is low at an estimated 45%—the same as English. The common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages allow for a greater amount of interlingual reading comprehension than oral communication would.</p>
<p><small>1. Also <i>nós outros</i> in early modern Portuguese (e.g. <i>The Lusiads</i>).<br>
2. Alternatively <i>nous autres</i> in French.<br>
3. Also <i>noialtri</i> in Southern Italian dialects and languages.<br>
4. Depending on the written norm used (see Reintegracionism).<br>
5. Medieval Catalan (e.g. <i>Llibre dels fets</i>).<br>
6. Note that Romanian <i>caș</i> (from Latin cāsevs) means a type of cheese. The universal term for cheese in Romanian is <i>brânză</i> (from unknown etymology).</small></p>
<h3> Judaeo-Spanish</h3>

<p>Judaeo-Spanish (also known as Ladino), which is essentially medieval Spanish and closer to modern Spanish than any other language, is spoken by many descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century. Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German. Ladino speakers are currently almost exclusively Sephardi Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece or the Balkans; current speakers mostly live in Israel and Turkey, and the United States, with a few pockets in Latin America. It lacks the Native American vocabulary which was influential during the Spanish colonial period, and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from Hebrew, French, Greek and Turkish, and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.</p>
<p>Judaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly <i>olim</i> (immigrants to Israel) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.</p>
<p>A related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.</p>
<h2> Writing system</h2>

<p>Spanish is written in the Latin script, with the addition of the character ⟨ñ⟩ (<i>eñe</i>, representing the phoneme /ɲ/, a letter distinct from ⟨n⟩, although typographically composed of an ⟨n⟩ with a tilde) and the digraphs ⟨ch⟩ (<i>che</i>, representing the phoneme /t͡ʃ/) and ⟨ll⟩ (<i>elle</i>, representing the phoneme /ʎ/). However, the digraph ⟨rr⟩ (<i>erre fuerte</i>, 'strong r', <i>erre doble</i>, 'double r', or simply <i>erre</i>), which also represents a distinct phoneme /r/, is not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨ll⟩ have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes, though they remain a part of the alphabet. Words with ⟨ch⟩ are now alphabetically sorted between those with ⟨cg⟩ and ⟨ci⟩, instead of following ⟨cz⟩ as they used to. The situation is similar for ⟨ll⟩.</p>
<p>Thus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters and 2 digraphs:</p>
<dl><dd><i>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Ch, Ll</i>.</dd>
</dl><p>The letters ⟨k⟩ and ⟨w⟩ are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages (<i>kilo, folklore, whisky, William</i>, etc.).</p>
<p>With the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as <i>México</i> (see Toponymy of Mexico), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including ⟨y⟩) or with a vowel followed by ⟨n⟩ or an ⟨s⟩; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel.</p>
<p>The acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare <i>el</i> ('the', masculine singular definite article) with <i>él</i> ('he' or 'it'), or <i>te</i> ('you', object pronoun) with <i>té</i> ('tea'), <i>de</i> (preposition 'of') versus <i>dé</i> ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and <i>se</i> (reflexive pronoun) versus <i>sé</i> ('I know' or imperative 'be').</p>
<p>The interrogative pronouns (<i>qué</i>, <i>cuál</i>, <i>dónde</i>, <i>quién</i>, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives (<i>ése</i>, <i>éste</i>, <i>aquél</i>, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted in capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the <i>Real Academia Española</i> advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.</p>
<p>When ⟨u⟩ is written between ⟨g⟩ and a front vowel ⟨e i⟩, it indicates a "hard g" pronunciation. A diaeresis ⟨ü⟩ indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., <i>cigüeña</i>, 'stork', is pronounced [θiˈɣweɲa]; if it were written *<i>cigueña</i>, it would be pronounced *[θiˈɣeɲa]).</p>
<p>Interrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with inverted question and exclamation marks (⟨¿⟩ and ⟨¡⟩, respectively).</p>
<h2> Organizations</h2>
<h3> Royal Spanish Academy</h3>


<p>The <i>Real Academia Española</i> (Royal Spanish Academy), founded in 1713, together with the 21 other national ones (see Association of Spanish Language Academies), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides. Because of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language (Standard Spanish) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
