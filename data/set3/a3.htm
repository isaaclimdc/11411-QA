<h1>Hindi</h1>
<p><b>Hindi</b>, or more precisely <b>Modern Standard Hindi</b> (also known as <i>Manak Hindi</i>,<i>High Hindi</i>, <i>Nagari Hindi</i>, and <i>Literary Hindi</i><sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>), is a standardised and sanskritised register of the Hindustani language. It is the native language of people living in Delhi, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, northeastern Madhya Pradesh, and parts of eastern Rajasthan, and is one of the official languages of the Republic of India. But many non-native speakers from other parts of India, too, understand it easily because it is close to their native languages that, just like Hindi, originated from various Prakrit languages. These languages have common roots and the native speakers of several regional Indian languages find it easier to understand the more Sanskritised form of Hindi.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>Colloquial Hindi is mutually intelligible with another register of Hindi-Urdu called (Modern Standard) Urdu. Mutual intelligibility decreases in literary and specialized contexts which rely on educated vocabulary. The number of native speakers of Standard Hindi is unclear. According to the 2001 Indian census, 258 million people in India reported their native language to be "Hindi". However, this includes large numbers of speakers of Hindi languages other than Standard Hindi; as of 2009, the best figure <i>Ethnologue</i> could find for Khariboli dialect (the basis of Hindustani) was a 1991 citation of 180 million. This places Hindi in a three-way tie with Bengali and Portuguese for the fifth-largest language in the world.</p>
<h2> Official status</h2>
<p>The Indian constitution, adopted in 1950, declares Hindi shall be written in the Devanagari script and will be the official language of the Federal Government of India. However, English continues to be used as an official language along with Hindi. Hindi is also enumerated as one of the twenty-two languages of the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, which entitles it to representation on the Official Language Commission. The Constitution of India has stipulated the usage of Hindi and English to be the two languages of communication for the Central Government. Most government documentation is prepared in three languages: English, Hindi, and the official language of the local state.</p>
<p>It was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Central government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351), with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as the anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu) and in West Bengal, led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes. However, the constitutional directive to champion the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced the policies of the Union government.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup></p>
<p>At the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following states: Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi. Each may also designate a "co-official language"; in Uttar Pradesh for instance, depending on the political formation in power, sometimes this language is Urdu. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of co-official language in several additional states.</p>
<h2> History</h2>

<p>The dialect upon which Standard Hindi is based is <i>khadiboli</i>, the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding western Uttar Pradesh and southern Uttarakhand region. This dialect acquired linguistic prestige in the Mughal Empire (17th century) and became known as <i>Urdu</i>, "the language of the court." As noted and referenced in History of Hindustani, prior to the independence of India and Pakistan, it was not referred to as Urdu but as Hindustani. After independence, the Government of India set about standardising Hindi as a separate language from Urdu, instituting the following conventions:<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>original research?</i>]</sup></p>
<ul><li>standardization of grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee's report was released in 1958 as "A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi"</li>
<li>standardization of the orthography, using the Devanagari script, by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing, to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters, and introducing diacritics to express sounds from other languages.</li>
</ul><p>The Constituent Assembly adopted Hindi as the Official Language of the Union on 14 September 1949. Hence it is celebrated as Hindi Day.</p>
<p>In the year 1881 Bihar accepted Hindi as its sole official language replacing Urdu and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi.</p>
<h2> Sanskrit vocabulary</h2>

<p>Formal Standard Hindi draws much of its academic vocabulary from Sanskrit. Standard Hindi loans words are classified into five principal categories:</p>
<ul><li><i><b>Tatsam</b></i> (तत्सम / <i>same as that</i>) words: These are words which are spelled the same in Hindi as in Sanskrit (except for the absence of final case inflections). They include words inherited from Sanskrit via Prakrit which have survived without modification (e.g. Hindustani <i>nām</i>/Sanskrit <i>nāma</i>, "name"; Hindustani <i>Suraj</i>/Sanskrit <i>Surya</i>, "sun"), as well as forms borrowed directly from Sanskrit in more modern times (e.g. <i>prārthanā</i>, "prayer"). Pronunciation, however, conforms to Hindi norms and may differ from that of classical Sanskrit. Among nouns, the <i>tatsam</i> word could be the Sanskrit uninflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.</li>
<li><i><b>Ardhatatsam</b></i> (अर्धतत्सम) words: These are words that were borrowed from Sanskrit in the middle Indo-Aryan or early New Indo-Aryan stages.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup> Such words typically have undergone sound changes subsequent to being borrowed.</li>
<li><i><b>Tadbhav</b></i> (तद्भव / <i>born of that</i>) words: These are words which are spelled differently from Sanskrit but are derivable from a Sanskrit prototype by phonological rules (e.g. Sanskrit <i>karma</i>, "deed" becomes Pali <i>kamma</i>, and eventually Hindi <i>kām</i>, "work").</li>
<li><i><b>Deshaj</b></i> (देशज) words: These are words that were not borrowings but do not derive from attested Indo-Aryan words either. Belonging to this category are onomatopoetic words.</li>
<li><i><b>Videshī</b></i> (विदेशी/ 'Foreign') words: these include all words borrowed from sources other than Indo-Aryan. The most frequent sources of borrowing in this category have been Persian, Arabic, Portuguese and English.</li>
</ul><p>The Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been purged and replaced by <i>tatsam</i> words, is called <i>Shuddha Hindi</i> (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a prestige dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.</p>
<p>Similarly, Urdu treats its own vocabulary, borrowed directly from Persian and Arabic, as a separate category for morphological purposes. Excessive use of <i>tatsam</i> words creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in native Hindi. The educated middle class of India may be able to pronounce such words, but others have difficulty. Persian and Arabic vocabulary given 'authentic' pronunciations cause similar difficulty.</p>
<h2> Literature</h2>

<p>Hindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being <i>Bhakti</i> (devotional – Kabir, Raskhan); <i>Shringar</i> (beauty – Keshav, Bihari); <i>Veer-Gatha</i> (extolling brave warriors); and <i>Adhunik</i> (modern).</p>
<p>Medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was not written in the current dialect but in other Hindi languages, particularly in Avadhi and Braj Bhasha, but later also in Khariboli. During the British Raj, Hindustani became the prestige dialect. Hindustani with heavily Sanskritized vocabulary or <i>Sahityik</i> Hindi (Literary Hindi) was popularized by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular among the educated people. Chandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi. The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement.</p>
<p>The <i>Dwivedi Yug</i> ("Age of Dwivedi") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing the Modern Hindi language in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as <i>Chhayavaad</i> (<i>shadowism</i>) and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as <i>Chhayavaadi</i>. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major <i>Chhayavaadi</i> poets.</p>
<p><i>Uttar Adhunik</i> is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the Chhayavaadi movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.</p>
